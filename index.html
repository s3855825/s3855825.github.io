    <h1>Team Profile</h1><br>
    <div>
      <h3>Team Name</h3>
      <p><b>GROUP 1</b>: We choose this name because it has two meanings. The first one is we want to be in the group of
        pioneers in IT that change the world, we have huge ambition in our major. The second one is when we were forming
        our teams on canvas, we saw that no one took the first slot, although the second one had been taken so we
        decided to take it.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Personal Information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h5>Nguyen Hung Vinh</h5>
          <p>He was born on 3rd August, 1999 in Can Tho city, Vietnam. He’s also called Arno once in a while, but still,
            mostly is Vinh. He’s the eldest and also the most introverted guy of the team. Playing games, especially
            MOBA games and reading books are his favorite hobbies. Due to being an introverted person so he’s usually
            shy to make new friends, even though he loves it. The first time that he found his interest in IT was when
            he was in high school. During that time, he has already done some small research about IT fields and was
            totally struck by them. Later on, he has also realized that he had the ability to do problem solving and get
            on well with algorithms, and ever since then, he made up his mind to choose to be a Back-End developer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Tran Minh Duc</h5>
          <p>He was born in Hanoi. He is more likely a patient and calm person based on his look. He does not talk a
            lot. He is, however, still friendly and approachable. It’s just because he usually prefers to be alone to
            focus easily on his work. Duc found his interest in IT ever since he was in secondary school. Specifically,
            during the first time he was introduced to Pascal, he began to like it. However, it was not until he was in
            the second year of his high school that he began to learn programming. His first project was a Tic-tac-toe
            game that competed with AI, but he didn’t know how to make the GUI at that time so he still has a long way
            to go, since study is a whole life journey.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Nguyen Vinh Quang</h5>
          <p>He was born on 23rd June, 2000 in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. He is also at times called Edward, or simply
            just Ed. Quang is keen on playing sports, reading science books, and playing games with his friends during
            his past-time. Ever since he was in secondary school, he has read research relating to science. However, it
            was after he finished his presentation about ASIMO robots that sparked his interest in the IT field, to be
            more specific, it was about AI (Artificial Intelligence). Still, at the moment, he has a long way to go and
            there are many things he has to learn before realizing his true path.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Ngo Nhat Minh</h5>
          <p>Minh was born on 21st September, 2001 in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. Sometimes he is misclaimed as an Indian
            due to his look, however, he is 100% Vietnamese. Minh is keen on playing video games and sports, hanging out
            with his friends and chit-chatting. The most interesting thing about him is he’s the only one vegan in the
            team, but, he is also the biggest and tallest in the team. He found his interest in IT when he was in the
            first grade of high school. .

      <h3>Team Profile</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h5>Minh Duc</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Test 1 – Learning Style Test:<br>
              Based on this test, Duc is a visual learner, which means he tends to remember things by reading and/or
              seeing the pictures. He has the ability to imagine and brings everything that he’s learning into his
              visual picture in his mind. In addition, he also doesn’t like to study in a crowded or noisy place, where
              he can be distracted easily by the background noises.
            </li>
            <li>Test 2 – Myer Briggs Personality Test:<br>
              He tends to be an introverted person who would always rather work behind the scene than taking the
              spotlight. Moreover, he considers himself as a “fixer”, which means he is able to handle problems related
              to his team’s work whenever it comes up.
            </li>
            <li>Test 3 – Colour Personality Test:<br>
              There’s nothing much to say about the result of this test since it’s similar to the Myer Briggs test
              above. As mentioned, Duc tends to work individually in order to push himself to work as best as he can. On
              the other hand, it recommends him for being patient and kind towards everyone, and luckily, he already got
              all of them.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Vinh Quang</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Test 1 – Myer Briggs Personality Test:<br>
              According to this test and based on the team’s opinion, Quang truly is an extroverted, who has the ability
              to link his teammates together and form the bonds between them. He is the one and only perfectionist in
              this team because he wants everything he does to be nearly, or even perfect. However, fortunately, he is
              lazy every once in a while, and thereby, it somehow helps him to not push himself over his limit.
            </li>
            <li>Test 2 – Learning Style Test:<br>
              Quang and Duc share the same learning style, which means they both are good at visualizing things that
              they have learned and picturing them in their head. Quang also is easily distracted by noise. In contrast,
              he loves to work in pairs or groups because he wants to get to know others’ point of view and is willing
              to help each other.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Nhat Minh</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Test 1 – Myer Briggs Personality Test:<br>
              Based on the results, Minh somehow is an extroverted, which is totally adverse to his expectation that he
              is an introverted due to his disapproval in social interactions. He is more likely a logistic type rather
              than the emotional one.

            </li>
            <li>Test 2 – Learning Style Test:<br>
              Minh’s learning style mostly is auditory, which means he can learn effectively by hearing. His ideal study
              environment is the classroom, where he can have the ability to comprehend, analyse the lecture and retain
              the information.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Hung Vinh</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Test 1 – Myer Briggs Personality Test:<br>
              The test results reflect nearly 90% accuracy about his character that he’s more likely an introverted, but
              also sometimes he could be an extroverted because he still loves to make friends and widen his social
              relationship. He focuses on the team’s or social harmony, balancing the connection between the
              participants rather than competing. Even though he is not creative most of the time, he still can be able
              to support the team’s idea and at times giving the contrast idea in order to make it more reasonable.
            </li>
            <li>Test 2 – Learning Style Test:<br>
              My result goes the same as Minh’s, we both tend to listen and read out loud the information so that we can
              remember it for a long time, rather than reading and writing. Surprisingly that my learning basis is also
              reading in my head the lecture in order to store the information and remember it effectively.
            </li>

      <h3>Career Plans</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Tran Minh Duc: Chooses Solution Architect as his future career</li>
        <li>Nguyen Vinh Quang: He chooses the same path as Duc, Solution Architect for his future career</li>
        <li>Ngo Nhat Minh: He chooses to be a Java Developer for career in the future</li>
        <li>Nguyen Hung Vinh: He chooses to be a Data Engineer as his career in the future</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Similarities</h5>
      <p>It can be clearly seen that there are some similar requirements we have to achieve in order to get a decent
        job. First of all, it is undeniable that a bachelor degree is the most vital thing that we have to achieve for
        our future career. Such formal qualifications are proof to show that we are fully equipped with in-depth
        knowledge to meet the job’s requirements. Moreover, essential skills which relate to the job should also be
        sharpened while we are still in the university, alongside with some specific knowledge about other programming
        languages like Python, Java, C# and so on.
      </p>
      <h5>Differences</h5>
      <p>Although there are some related aspects, we still have our own different interests in the IT field so it is
        clear that our future path will be separated. To be more specific, there are some minor areas in IT that one
        person may be good at, but others may don’t. Nevertheless, we do believe that each area has their own interest
        which we can learn something new and intriguing about them and therefore, it could facilitate our career in the
        future.

      <h3>Group Processes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In terms of Assignment 2, in general, we did our best so we are pretty confident about each aspect of the
          assignment even though we are usually on the go with our other courses. By communicating with each other
          frequently and providing support and contrast ideas towards the members, the bond between the members are
          strengthened day by day since our working time is always surrounded by a comfortable atmosphere. We all hope
          that our hard work will pay off in the near future, when the result is released.
        </li>
        <li>
          About the upcoming Assignment 3, so far we have already separated works for the team members and things mostly
          seem to be on track. Despite our workload being much heavier compared to the previous assignments and at times
          there are some obstacles, we are always ready and happy to support each other to find ways to solve them. We
          do believe that if we work hard enough, the prototype of our project will be done sone before meeting its
          deadline.

      <li>
        Our GitHub repository: https://github.com/s3855825/cosc2083_final_project
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It is a website so it such have both versions in computers and smartphones:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Software</b>: the website is built with Flask, a light-weight Python web framework. I choose SQLite to
            be our database because it is self-contained; as opposed to MySQL, which requires it to be hosted on a
            server so I consider that a bit overkill for our small website. We also don’t use any framework for our
            website’s front-end, and use simply plain HTML and CSS.
          </li>
          <li><b>Hardware</b>: we don’t use any special hardware for this project.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Skills:
        <ul>
          <li>Programming skill and familiarity with Python and Flask framework is required. In addition, we also learn
            how to model our database and connect it to the website. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Outcome
        <ul>
          <li>We made a small website with what we consider to be a really limited amount of features that we can afford
            to work on within this semester.

    <h1>Project Description</h1><br>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h5>Topic</h5>
        <p>GROUP 1’s project is a website for our student community named RMIT student network (RSN). Instead of
          struggling to find teammates for assignments in an online or offline approach, RSN will be a new area for
          students. The same with other social networks, such as Facebook or Instagram, users can post and share things
          in the newsfeed. Although users now are RMIT students and things are requests, not pictures and status.
          Moreover, the website is not only helping finding partners but also the most suitable one. Each student has
          their own personal information which includes credit points, biography and feedback of the previous team. When
          a student approaches a post of another student, they will see all of the information so that student can
          decide teams or people most appropriate to work with.
          <br>
          RSN will be controlled by RMIT so that the transparency can be maintained. Lecturers who are responsible for
          the class will have the right to see the process of the group in order to keep nothing wrong happen. Overall,
          RMIT student network is a credible workplace for students, parasites and lazy people who need to try harder to
          gain others’ trust if they do not want to be excluded from the class. With our group, we are trying to make a
          prototype and hope that our project can catch RMIT’s interest. If RSN makes it to be operated, it will be a
          memorable memory and a big milestone for us. If not, it can still be beneficial to our CV.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Motivation</h5>
        <p>Four of us have come up with many ideas since week 1. However, most of the projects are unrealistic or unable
          to make at the moment. Therefore, we thought about some problems that exist at RMIT and one of them is the
          forming team for assignment.
          <br>
          Firstly, most students, especially students from the School of Business and Management, have a lot of
          coursework that requires working as a group. It is a huge challenge for everyone to find suitable teammates.
          When using Facebook to find partners in the RMIT group, it takes time to search for related content because it
          has a diversity of topic. For example, accommodation and finding roommates. Moreover, not everyone uses
          Facebook so for people in this group is a disadvantage to them.
          <br>
          Secondly, there are some risks when forming a group for the first time of a semester. Students cannot know
          what type or how well the collaborator is. There are many situations that have been happened, such as
          teammates does not work effectively as they said at the beginning or the effort, they spend is not equal to
          the group’s goals. Plus, some students are really late in forming a team or find it difficult in talking with
          people. They will fall behind and might be insufficient time to work on the project.
          <br>
          In addition, this project is trying to support RMIT students in coursework and creating a professional online
          workplace. It solves the problems of forming a team and encouraging students to work hard and be responsible
          for their decision. For our career, this project will be a proof for our achievement, vision and experience to
          future employers.

        <h5>Landscape</h5>
        <img
          src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9o7cOs_QKSo27vql1Lr4Vx1KVZCxuC7Fu35FUWS0ZBO-R6h6I5EDob1yDekFFj0dOQCFyad25TUsnu8pxjpSBUbbP70CS-FO1ANwZQFjWPi12VHBoV_kVlbYVHsCKiCb2uygpitND3tH7G_F">
        <p>Our biggest competitor is Facebook. At the moment, the RMIT Vietnam society group has nearly 6000
          members.<br>
          We can see that there is a big community with a lot of posts about different subjects. Thus, finding the post
          we want is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Moreover, students might miss the post that they need.
          Another problem is we cannot know who we will cooperate with. Most students find that they conflict with their
          teammates while they are doing the assignment. That means they cannot move to another group during the
          assessment due to the deadline for the formation and registration of the team.
          <br>
          RSN can overcome those problems by its functions. At the beginning of the semester, the previous post from the
          corresponding subject will be deleted by lectures so that we can make sure that everything in the newsfeed is
          related to the current semester. Moreover, RSN will separate each Schools of RMIT into different sections.
          Before viewing posts, students need to choose the School they are studying. Lastly, not like Facebook,
          students can look at others’ information which contains a brief about themselves, previous activities, credit
          points and feedback. The value of credit points and feedbacks is evaluated by last teammates. These segments
          will be a tool for students to find ideal collaborators. RSN also has the group chat section, where is a
          workplace for all members. They can set up deadlines, upload files and conversations.

  <div id="project-aims" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>Aims</h1><br>
    <p>Our target is developing a website that RMIT students can use to form a group and work on assignments. As
      discussed above, we want to create an equitable and effective virtual environment. To achieve that purpose, we
      need to fulfill some specific goals. The first goal is to have a prototype for the demo pitch on presentation day.
      Next, try to gain attention from the RMIT community. Finally, working on the completed website before operating
      it.
      <br>
      Firstly, we have planned RSN since week 2 of the course. However, until week 9, we can start to make it because of
      previous deadlines. Although our group is first-year students, we are confident that we have enough experience to
      make a prototype. Recently, we are reading and searching for HTML resources by books and websites like W3schools.
      Our base codes will not have professional CSS to display our website because we do not have enough time to focus
      on that part. The final result for the first goal is having a web can steadily perform its main functions so that
      we can show it in a presentation.
      <br>
      Secondly, RSN must be approved by the RMIT community which not only the teachers but also students. The
      presentation will be the first opportunity to introduce our project and amaze our lectures. RMIT staffs always
      encourage and support students’ ideas so we can feel more self-assured to them even our product has not been
      perfect yet. If our project is applied, lectures will be the administrator of the website, the same with canvas.
      Because of that, they need to understand and agree to use RSN. Equality between people is the top priority at RMIT
      so everyone has the right to give opinions. Not only from staff but RSN also need to be agreed by students before
      going to operate. We need to point out problems for them and introduce the website. Our friends will be the first
      group to try and ask for their feedback.
      <br>
      Finally, the last goal to fulfill our aims is having a perfect web-ready to use. When we achieve this goal, it
      means that we have to reach our destination. At this point, RSN will have a perfect background and functions for
      students’ demand. However, to get from present to that objective, we need to study a lot about web programming to
      develop our website. Therefore, we might need support from experts or higher students to help us in this project,
      if it is approved. When everything is ready, we cannot wait to see how it will positively change RMIT students.
    </p>

  <div id="project-plan" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>Plan and Progresses</h1><br>
    <p>At the start of the planning stage, we decide to choose one out of four project ideas each member of our group
      proposed in assignment 1. While they are all good ideas, all of our group members agree we prefer a more
      'realistic' project. We want to work on a project that can solve RMIT students' problems. So we scrapped our
      proposed ideas and focused on finding a problem we can solve and making a prototype for our solution. In the end,
      we arrive at our idea: a webapp to help students find partners for their group projects.<br>
      Users will need to have a RMIT email address to sign up for our 'service', so we can link their account to their
      RMIT account on Canvas so we can find out which courses that student took in the previous semesters and which
      grade they got. On this website, we want students to be able to do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Write Post</b>: student can post on a dashboard to find partners for a group project, specifying what they
        need. Other students can apply for the position, specifying what they bring to the table, and the original
        poster can choose their group partner from a list of applicants.</li>
      <li><b>Rate</b>: at the end of the project, group members can rate each other based on their performance
        throughout that group project: were they actively contributing to the project, or did they just put in minimal
        effort required, ... and write a comment to justify their rating. Ratings and comments will be visible to

        Since most of our group members are inexperienced and unfamiliar with IT in general, specifically programming,
        we plan to make our prototype a simple website. While we want to make the prototype as simple as possible to
        suit our group's capabilities, we still have some difficulties due to our inexperience. It took us 2 weeks, week
        9 and 10, to have a working basic user registration and logging model.

    <h1>Roles</h1><br>
    We decided early in the process who will handle which part of the project.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Duc</b></li>
          <li> Since he is already familiar with programming and took the database course last semester, he will handle
            most of the website's functions: user registration and logging, interactions, ... He also decides the
            technologies used in our project and handles our GitHub repository.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Vinh</b></li>
          <li>He writes our group profiles, scopes and limits part of the report. He also supports Duc on front-end
            issues.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Minh</b></li>
          <li> He volunteered to write most of the report, since writing is his strongest suite. He also supports Duc on
            front-end issues.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Quang</b></li>
          <li>
            The idea for our final project is his, so he 'designed' our solutions: what we are trying to solve, how we
            approach the problem, and how the website would look like. He also supports Duc on front-end issues.

  <div id="project-scope" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>Scope and Limits</h1><br>
    <p>Honestly, in order to come up with this project, we had to spend the first 3 weeks of the semester to think about
      it and make comparisons between the other members’ ideas. Finally, we made up our mind to choose this project
      because we think that this is the most suitable one which can be applied directly for our school if it’s put into
      use. In general, fortunately that we all take high responsibility for our tasks and work together well without
      negative arguments so things seem to go on track and are more likely to be completed before the deadline,
      therefore we can have much more time to adjust and test the project to make sure it is around 80-90% error-free
      focus on other things.
      <br>
      As we have mentioned earlier in the Assignment 2, we are planning to create a social-media application
      specifically for RMIT students, where they can form groups or find their teammates who are suitable for their
      goals for the assignments and it’s named RMIT Student Network (RSN). Thus, users will use their student or teacher
      ID as accounts to sign up and log in to the website. Obviously that the users need to fully provide their general
      information such as full name, ID, major and so on. We have also calculated that there will be thousands of users
      using the website if it is applied in use in the future, so the website will be deployed on the Heroku Cloud
      Server. This website provides an appropriate environment for all the students to find their teammates who aim the
      same targets. To be more specific, it is more likely a combination of Canvas and Facebook. It will contain similar
      functionalities like Home page, Search bar, Profile Page, Notification and a Group list which has a chat box for
      students to communicate with their friends.
      <br>
      However, there are some distinctions about RSN’s features compared to mentioned social media. The first one is the
      Home section, instead of showing global news or “status”, it will display posts related to the users’ major.
      During the first time that a user log in to the website, as mentioned before, they will be asked to provide
      general information, including their major, or in other words, their School that they are currently studying like
      SST, SBM, SCD or SEUP so that the website can provide relevant post about their major. Moreover, there is a Status
      section, where students can post what they want, exactly just like Facebook or Twitter, but there is another
      special function which allows them to public their offer to form or find group for their study-related-works or
      events, the same thing can also be applied for the groups’ recruitment so as to find their suitable teammates. The
      announcement about the members’ contribution or who wants to collaborate with them will be shown in the
      Announcement Box. Subsequently, the bio of the users will be shown in the Profile section, namely date of birth
      (DoB), name, ID, facts or some small stories about themselves (this is optional). Besides, it also demonstrates
      credit points and feedback from the team members who worked with them in the previous courses, this is the most
      important tool to evaluate the attitude of the students when working in groups, users will be given their credit
      points when they signed up the account, 2000 at the start. This credit point will depend on the students’
      contribution and attitude throughout the time that they work with their teams positively or negatively.
      Nonetheless, for the new students, they can only choose students who have the same point (2000) and their bio.
      <br>
      The most vital part of RSN is to create an appropriate academic environment for RMIT students to encourage their
      study and take full responsibility while working with their group mates. Whenever a student wants to post a
      request for joining a group, they have to fully provide what their goal is (HD, DI for example) and their course
      code so that RSN can find results that nearly match the student’s requirements. However, the website also has its
      own function to avoid teammates who have bad attitudes or are lazy participating in the DI or HD groups just by
      looking back at their current credit point.
      <br>
      However, RSN is still a prototype and being tested frequently so there are some bugs that need to be fixed.
      Moreover, we all lack professional IT-related skills so there are some errors we can’t figure out how to provide
      the resolution right now. For instance, we got some trouble while working on GitHub, specifically, at times we
      pushed our files on the wrong branch of other members. Secondly, we couldn’t find ways to connect our HTML files
      and make it work correctly or there are errors occurred when we use the CSS. In general, this prototype is just a
      clear example for the judges so that they can imagine how our project looks like and how it works.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="project-test" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>Testing and Tools</h1><br>
    <h3>Tools</h3>
    <p>Taking into account that it is a website; it is highly plausible for it to have both versions in computers and
      smartphones. Briefly speaking, the software will be a website with the security of RMIT, possessing an account as
      the same as the Canvas. Likewise, the phone version, it can be an application so that it’s much easier to access
      and capable of better interaction. Whereas the current hardware will be able to run all of the operating systems,
      while perhaps in the far future if success were to be made; access to the University’s Server may be a part of the
      hardware. Moving onto the divided workload in our team, Đức. Who has experiences in HTML together with various
      means of coding and Github usage; will be mainly in charge of fleshing out the project functionality such as the
      operating and sorting system. Quang, who will be focusing on the decoration part of the whole process, for
      instance, making it the designs eye-catching or not too overwhelming/underwhelming; will also be cooperating as
      the secondary coder alongside Duc. Meanwhile, the remaining members of the team; Vĩnh and Minh, will be handling
      the writing aspects of the project with supplementary work such as addressing updates for later testing or other
      information to the local users, while also serving as other means of communication between the developer and the
      users for example; delivering reported bugs or feedbacks to the entirety of the team or honorable messages from
      the developers themselves back to the people. Furthermore, they’re also likely to specify the given updates or
      answers any existing questions that may be given by the application’s user. It is also preferable to mention here
      that all four of the members are equipped with knowledge regarding HTML, but have gathered and collectively agreed
      to spill the work in the aforementioned parts to keep it organized. In short, Đức as the main coder with Quang as
      the secondary coder. While Minh and Vĩnh are the writers and communicators. There isn’t necessarily special
      hardware needed to run this website as it only requires high experiences in HTML, JavaScript, Machine Learning,
      and Database.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <h5>Test plan</h5>
    <p>Generally, when it comes to any type of new product before being launched, it would naturally be advised to do
      several testings first to ensure its’ fullest function to be operational. Likewise, we intend to test our project
      by various means; mainly splitting it into two main parts. With the first one being; exposing our volunteers to
      the early stages of our craft. In these periods, consumers are anticipated to get a comfortable feel of the system
      as they are allowed to take their time in exploring the various functions of the website. Test users will be free
      in expressing their opinions, criticism along most importantly giving feedbacks; all of which is a constructive
      and helpful manner. If things sail out smoothly as planned and the audience is blissful with what the prototype is
      offering; as seen from their reaction to the new creation, then momentarily moving onto the more finalized stage
      wouldn’t be too much of a hassle. Discussions regarding topics such as suggesting a more home-friendly interior
      design specially to make it as enjoyable as possible for everyone; since we’re looking to create an everlasting
      stable flame rather than a sudden bursting spark. Additionally, requesting an uncomplicated format with any parts
      that they may stumble and find tedious is also permitted as it will help make the whole stay much more pleasing.
      Furthermore, to some degree; Beta Users will be involved to see if any possible errors may hinder the process of
      the whole program, along with reports apropos of any possible existing bugs in the system. The fruits of our labor
      will be shown once our generous helpers can harness the complete potential together with grasping the entire usage
      of the project without any mishaps occurring. These may include; posting their first entry, creating and settling
      down in a good group with their friends, being matched with people with similar interests or hobbies. After all,
      this platform does indeed revolve around the concept of a sorting system, a means to help students connect
      comfortably. As mentioned above, we’re hoping to gain tester by helpful or friendly people who are willing to
      volunteer to do the required jobs together with offering support and help to the program whenever needed.
      Approximately 10-15 number of people will be enough. In addition to this, there won’t be any background necessary
      for this either.</p>
    <h5>Risks</h5>
    <p>Bugs always appear in technology. It is like a fundamental issue that every programmer will face when they run
      their product. Especially the project that developed by beginners, we have thought about some risks that might
      happen when we make and operate RSN:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Crash</b>: Different websites have different traffic for users’ requests. The low quality of websites can
        be crashed with 1000 people access at the same time. Sometimes, a big website like Facebook can be crashed,
        although it is recovered very fast. In the middle of the semester, the number of students that use our website
        could touch around 1000 – 2000 students that use RSN at the same time. The risk of crashing cannot be avoided if
        the web does not have a strong host and up-to-date source code. Students will be the most affected when RSN goes
        down.</li>
      <li><b>Lack of knowledge</b>: Another problem when we work on the project is, we do not know how to fix some bugs.
        Not every member of our team has experience in making real products so it is very time-consuming to debug,
        because we need to read through a lot of senior materials and try to understand it.

    Regardless of whether or not you’re introverted or extroverted, each group of people tends to have their unique way
    of communicating with one another. With all due respect, my particular members tend to discuss topics through social
    media such as Messenger, or Skype. Whereas for instance; for our advisers, lecturers, professionals, we prefer a
    more suitable approach by sending them emails rather than considering their more superior ranking. Our meetings tend
    to occur between 2-3 days a week depending on our teammates’ leisure time, whether they’d be unoccupied to
    participate or not. With that being said, this also applies to both online meets up along with face to face
    appointment, as it all varies regarding other factors including the time and place. If the unfortunate happens, say
    one of our group members is unable to give a proper response to us; then a conventional gathering will be held with
    the remaining collaborator to come up with a definitive conclusion. Once the final decision has been made apropos of
    the issue about the absent teammate or once we have received news together with an explanation as to why they

    Considering that our project idea revolves around the concept of building an entirely new platform for RMIT
    scholars, for the sake of communication’s convenience and easier access to finding people with similar aspects as
    yourself. Likewise, with the aforementioned articles and the hypothetical possibility we were to be financially
    funded in building this website; nonetheless given the assigned role to be the manager of a team of 4 people, it is
    highly plausible that we will be needing specialist in these categories which includes: duo web developer, a
    designer, along with an UX/UI designer. To begin with, both web developer will be tasked with different things to
    work on. One will be focusing on the visual assets of the platform such as; the interior and exterior output of the
    website, coding previously mentioned designs together with fixing minor bugs and issues regarding the app’s
    interface. While the other web developer will be in charge of managing and organizing databases, various behind the
    scene cases, along with coding as well as proceeding on with heavy debugging if ever needed. Secondly, the
    designer’s duties will mainly be on decorating the displays of each and every corner of this particular innovation;
    these may involves managing the registration page (Sign in, Login page), the system’s profile page, additionally
    along with creating an uncomplicated settings module which is easy to understand and grasp in order to have a
    friendly interface for the users. Last but certainly not least, the UX/UI designer whom will be occupied with
    communicating between the team of creators and players. Furthermore, they are also the one who will put themselves
    in the shoes of the day-to-day users to see what implements shall be necessary to improve the platform’s quality. In
    simpler terms, they are needed for making and receiving constructive feedbacks in order to return previously said
    requests to the team members to discuss, work on and or fix for better improvement. As for required skills, we
    mainly focus on the broad knowledge of HTML and CSS, with the concept of Database, so the procedure of some
    operations will be done smoothly without any questions. A good sense of teamwork, confidence in giving out opinions,
    suggestions will also be crucial, in order to avoid most conflicts.
